# `@tonejs/midi` Fix

I created this repository to have an updated, npm-installable version for the `@tonejs/midi` package. 

The npm package is no longer maintained and does not contain some of the latest changes that were commited to the repository. This reposity is a fork of the original repository, with the latest changes merged in.

You can install this package by running:
``` bash
npm i tonejs-midi-fix
```
